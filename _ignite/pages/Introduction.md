# Ignite

Modern markdown documentation generator.

Ignite makes it super easy to get a documentation website running.

## Project Structure

The sidebar is the root of your app and is located in index.md. This file links to the rest of your documentation. Any linked `.md` files will be included in the docs website.

```markdown
* [Introduction](./Introduction.md)
* [Page 1](./pages/Page1.md)
* [Page 2](./pages/Page2.md)
```
