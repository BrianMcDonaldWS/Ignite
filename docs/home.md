# Ignite

## Zero Hassle Documentation

:::

## Finally, a markdown documentation generation tool built around plugins. /.no-link .has-text-primary .has-text-centered\

Ignite makes documenting your open source project as easy as adding files to a folder. The barrier to writing documentation should be low, encouraging us to write more of it! /.has-text-centered\

# Add Plugins

Ignite uses React, so we thought the simplest plugin system would just be plain old React components.

This means any react component can be exposed as a plugin for Ignite. The possibilities for expressive documentation are endless! Read more [here](pages/IgnitePlugins.md)

Blogging shouldn't be hard either! Why host posts about your product anywhere but with your documentation? All information about your project should be accessible from one easy to search location. Ignite makes this easy.
